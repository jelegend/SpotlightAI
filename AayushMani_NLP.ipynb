    "Hi Section (D)ynasty! I hope you all had a great RC year and are settling into your summer situations as comfortably as possible. By way of quick background, I have the great privilege of joining you all for EC Year. I originally entered HBS as part of the Class of 2019 (Section D), but left after RC year to work on a startup in the travel space called PlacePass, where I have spent the past two years. Given the current state of travel, I have decided that now is the best time to return to HBS to complete EC Year, and I am absolutely pumped to be joining Section (D)ynasty! While I have been living in Boston for the past 7+ years, I am now splitting time between Boston and Longmeadow, MA where I grew up – one perk of being able to work remotely! For those currently in the Boston area, feel free to shoot me an email if you’d like to meet up (socially distanced of course). For those who aren’t, I hope to have the opportunity to meet you in person at some point over the course of this year (ideally this fall!).\n",

Since being in quarantine I have tried to pick up the ukulele, teach myself Adobe Premiere to make videos, help an HKS alum write a book, be an Upkey mentor for students who lost their internships… and I’m in the middle of Whole30. It’s self-inflicted busy-ness but it makes me excited to be alive! And I’m so, so thankful to be able to have the resources and support to be able to spend quarantine the way I am.\n",
